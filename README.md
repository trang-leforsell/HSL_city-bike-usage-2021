# Relation of HSL's bike usage and population distribution in Helsinki and Espoo in 2021

# Project description
- HSL provides bike services for Helsinki and Espoo, but the services are still limited.
- The project uses Python to examine the pattern of bikes usage in Helsinki and Espoo in 2021 and recommend which regions HSL should build more bike stations.
- This project covers data manipulation, data visualization, and predictive analytics.
- This project is a collaborative effort by a team of four.

# Preliminary assumptions
- Area-specific population is correlated with total cycling distance and total cycling duration.
- Age group is correlated with geographical population distribution.
- Younger people live near the center than older people.

# Findings

1. Population of both Helsinki and Espoo is not evenly distributed. Some areas are significantly more populous than others.

2. There is no correlation between population density and total cycling distance in both Helsinki and Espoo.
- The total cycling distance is highest in the most densely populated areas.
- The total cycling distance is, however, remarkably low in other populous areas.

3. HSL can conduct market research to stimulate cycling habits in highly populated areas where cycling distance is notably low. These areas present promising opportunities for growth.

4. Young adults tend to live near the city centre while the elderly prefer to live on the outskirts.
